# Thuisbezorgd-menu-scraper
#### Scraping restaurant data and their menu items data from Thuisbezorgd

This was a project for the course Solving Societal Health Challenges with Data Science (CHL60309) at Wageningen University. 

## Goal of the project
This project was about understanding online food availability in the Netherlands via socioeconomic mapping. There is limited knowledge about how food is distributed and accessed via delivery platforms in the Netherlands, particularly in relation to regional socioeconomic factors. This gap limits the development of informed public health interventions and effective food policies. However, international studies have revealed a disproportionate availability of unhealthy food in lower socioeconomic areas. Therefore, it's important that the availability is mapped for the Netherlands as well.
